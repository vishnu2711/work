1.Here ‘C’ programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T(American Telephonic & Telegraphic) Bell Laboratories, New Jersey.
2.C can be used for creating computer applications, writing embedded software and also for writing applications which extend an operating system's functionality.
3.The core part of Linux operating system was completely developed in C language.

The instructions (called the source code) written in C are saved in a file with .c extension. For eg: Calculator.c. This is the source file.

There is a special program called compiler, which is used to compile the source file. Once compiled, an object file with extension .obj is created.

There is yet another program called linker, which combines one or more object files to create a single executable file. The executable file can have any extension. For example, files in Windows usually have .exe extension. These files are executed to get the desired output.
